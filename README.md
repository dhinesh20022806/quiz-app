# Quiz App

I built a Quiz App using ReactJS and react-router-dom to help users prepare for technical interviews. It features common interview questions for languages like HTML, CSS, ReactJS, NodeJS, Python, Angular, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, and JavaScript. Users select a language, answer timed questions, and see results instantly, with a final summary page displaying their performance.



The app uses React's virtual DOM for efficient UI updates, with key features including:

React Components for modularity

State Management with useState

Side Effects handled by useEffect

References with useRef for timer control

Timers using setTimeout and setInterval

Navigation with react-router-dom



This project demonstrates advanced React concepts like state management and efficient DOM manipulation. It enhances understanding of the virtual DOM, showcases practical use of React hooks, ensures an engaging user experience, and promotes code reusability and modularity.
